# Weather-Dashboard-06

--- On this assignment, we had to build a weather dashboard. This would display the weather for every city in the world, including the temperature, UV, wind, and humidity. ---

index.html - 
----------
* Added sections for the containers which store the weather data. 

* Used CSS properties and added them as classes.

style.css - 
---------
* Simple styles, like font changes.
 
script.js - 
---------
* Added some jQuery, as usual.
* Created a for loop to iterate through 5 days after the current day.
* Created a function to get data and display from APIs.
